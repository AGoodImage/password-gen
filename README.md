# password-generator

In this homework I created a password generator capable of generating a random password for a user.

The password can be 8-128 values.  The values include Special Characters, Numbers, Uppercase Leters and Lowercase Letters.

This homework uses Javascript to ask the User how many characters they would like for their password, followed by if the password includes the values meantioned.

After answers required questions a sercure password is generated and appears in the text box.

Steps to get secure random password:
   * Click Red Generate Password Button
   * Answer Required Promts
   * Password Appears in Textbox
